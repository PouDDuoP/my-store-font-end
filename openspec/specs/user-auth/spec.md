# User Auth Specification

## Purpose

JWT-based authentication system with login, register, profile management, and route protection for the my-store frontend.

## Requirements

### Requirement: User Login

The system SHALL allow users to authenticate using email and password credentials via POST `/api/v1/auth/login`. Upon successful authentication, the system SHALL store the JWT token in localStorage and update the reactive auth state.

#### Scenario: Successful login

- GIVEN user is on login page
- WHEN valid email and password are submitted
- THEN JWT token is stored in localStorage
- AND auth state signal is updated with user data
- AND user is redirected to home page

#### Scenario: Invalid credentials

- GIVEN user is on login page
- WHEN invalid email or password are submitted
- THEN error message is displayed
- AND no token is stored
- AND user remains on login page

#### Scenario: JWT injection on authenticated requests

- GIVEN user has valid JWT in localStorage
- WHEN any API request is made
- THEN AuthInterceptor SHALL inject `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- AND request proceeds normally

### Requirement: User Registration

The system SHALL allow new users to register with name, email, and password via POST `/api/v1/auth/register`.

#### Scenario: Successful registration

- GIVEN user is on register page
- WHEN valid name, email, and password are submitted
- THEN user account is created
- AND success message is displayed
- AND user is redirected to login page

#### Scenario: Duplicate email registration

- GIVEN user is on register page
- WHEN an existing email is submitted
- THEN error message indicates email already exists
- AND registration form remains populated

### Requirement: Route Protection

The system SHALL prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected routes using AuthGuard.

#### Scenario: Access protected route while unauthenticated

- GIVEN user is not logged in (no valid JWT)
- WHEN user navigates to `/profile` or other protected route
- THEN user is redirected to `/login`
- AND return URL is preserved for post-login redirect

#### Scenario: Access protected route while authenticated

- GIVEN user has valid JWT in localStorage
- WHEN user navigates to `/profile`
- THEN profile page loads normally
- AND user data is fetched from API

### Requirement: Password Recovery

The system SHALL allow users to request password recovery via POST `/api/v1/auth/recovery`.

#### Scenario: Valid recovery request

- GIVEN user is on login page
- WHEN user clicks "Forgot password" and enters valid email
- THEN recovery email is sent (simulated)
- AND confirmation message is displayed

#### Scenario: Invalid recovery request

- GIVEN user is on recovery page
- WHEN non-existent email is submitted
- THEN error message indicates email not found

### Requirement: Password Change

The system SHALL allow authenticated users to change their password via POST `/api/v1/auth/change-password`.

#### Scenario: Successful password change

- GIVEN user is authenticated and on profile page
- WHEN current password and new password are submitted correctly
- THEN password is updated successfully
- AND success message is displayed

#### Scenario: Incorrect current password
- GIVEN user is authenticated and on profile page
- WHEN incorrect current password is submitted
- THEN error message indicates current password is invalid

### Requirement: Login Page Layout

The system MUST render the login page with a distinct credentials zone visually separated from other page content, using the green/gray theme. The page MUST include the MS-KA logo, a heading "Login", and the auth form within a centered card-like container.

#### Scenario: Login page displays credentials zone

- GIVEN an unauthenticated user visits `/login`
- WHEN the page renders
- THEN a distinct card/section containing email and password inputs MUST be visible
- AND the MS-KA logo MUST be present in the header

#### Scenario: Login page uses theme colors

- GIVEN the login page renders
- WHEN inspected
- THEN the credentials zone MUST use `bg-white` with `border-gray-mid` and primary color accents

### Requirement: Auth Form Visual Styling

The system MUST style the `auth-form` component inputs and button using Tailwind theme tokens: inputs with `border-gray-mid` and focus `border-primary`, button with `bg-primary` text `text-white`, and proper spacing (`p-4`, `gap-4`). The form MUST have associated `<label>` elements for accessibility.

#### Scenario: Auth form inputs are styled

- GIVEN the auth form renders
- WHEN inspected
- THEN email and password inputs MUST have `border-gray-mid` and focus state `border-primary`

#### Scenario: Auth form submit button uses primary color

- GIVEN the auth form renders
- WHEN inspected
- THEN the submit button MUST have `bg-primary` and `text-white`

#### Scenario: Auth form is accessible

- GIVEN the auth form renders
- WHEN a screen reader reads the form
- THEN each input MUST have an associated `<label>` ("Email", "Password")

### Requirement: Login Behavior Unchanged

The system MUST preserve existing login behavior: on successful authentication, navigate to `/`; on failure, log the error to console. No API or service logic changes are permitted.

#### Scenario: Successful login navigates home

- GIVEN valid credentials are submitted
- WHEN the auth service returns success
- THEN the router MUST navigate to `/`

#### Scenario: Failed login logs error

- GIVEN invalid credentials are submitted
- WHEN the auth service returns an error
- THEN the error MUST be logged to console
